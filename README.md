# Bike-Sharing-Project
This project examines the effects of weather conditions throughout the year on the number of casual vs registered users of the bike sharing service.
The project uses the Bike Sharing dataset and asks the question: "What effects do environmental factors have on the number of registered vs casual users?"
RStudio was used to write the code behind this project and a slide was created using Microsoft PowerPoint. 
The slide shows a set of visuals which compare the effects of seasons, weather condition, temperature, humidity and wind speed on the numbers of casual vs registered users.
The slide also ranks the variables in the order of effect they have (positive or negative).
